# ATTENTION
This software is no longer being maintained (and hasn't been for quite a long time).
This requires an older version of libctru to compile. Try [version 1.4.0](https://github.com/devkitPro/libctru/releases/tag/v1.4.0).
Other than that, as long as your environment is setup correctly this *should* compile.

# ROT
A side project of mine. This is also my first 3DS homebrew, and first program written in C so there WILL be bugs.

Based on a batch program I used to maintain called RFGEP.
